# Predicting Housing Prices- Understanding Basics of Linear Regression Model

In the following project, we build a Machine Leanring model to predict the final sales prices for houses sold in Ames, Iowa. Our work is based on the dataset originally compiled by Dean De Cock for the primary purpose of having a high quality dataset for regression. 

- Each row in the dataset describes some properties of a single house and the amount for which it was sold. 
- We will try to build a model that predict the final sale price from its other attributes.
    - We will try and find which properties of a house most affects the final sale price?
    - How effectively we can predict the price of the house from just its properties?

Here are some of the columns:
- Lot Area: Lot size in square feet.
- Overall Qual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house.
- Overall Cond: Rates the overall condition of the house.
- Year Built: Original construction date.
- Low Qual Fin SF: Low quality finished square feet (all floors).
- Full Bath: Full bathrooms above grade.
- Fireplaces: Number of fireplaces.
