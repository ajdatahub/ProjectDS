    "# Analyzing Jeopardy Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/?st=jmwnphdw&sh=16abc86f).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show Number -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "- Air Date -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "- Round -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "- Category -- the category of the question.\n",
    "- Value -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "- Question -- the text of the question.\n",
    "- Answer -- the text of the answer.\n",
