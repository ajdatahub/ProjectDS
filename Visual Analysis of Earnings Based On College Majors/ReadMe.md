# Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors

The following effort shows the data analysis of the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between the years 2010 and 2012. 

The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. The cleaned data set can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors)

The dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more.

Following are some of the columns in the dataset - 

- Rank - Rank by median earnings (the dataset is ordered by this column).
- Major_code - Major code.
- Major - Major description.
- Major_category - Category of major.
- Total - Total number of people with major.
- Sample_size - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time.
- Men - Male graduates.
- Women - Female graduates.
- ShareWomen - Women as share of total.
- Employed - Number employed.
- Median - Median salary of full-time, year-round workers.
- Low_wage_jobs - Number in low-wage service jobs.
- Full_time - Number employed 35 hours or more.
- Part_time - Number employed less than 35 hours.

We will be working with the data set to learn and create data visualizations using scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, scatter matrix etc..

Using visualizations, the data can be explored to answer several questions and understand the relations among various aspects of data.
