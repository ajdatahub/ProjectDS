# Introduction to Decision Trees

Decision trees are a powerful and popular machine learning technique. The basic concept is very similar to trees that we commonly use to aid decision-making.

Machine Learning techniques enables us to automatically construct a decision tree that tells us what outcomes we should predict in certain situations.

The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome. 
- One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't.

The following work is a walk through of the building blocks of making a decision tree automatically.

We'll be looking at individual income in the United States. 
The data is from the 1994 census, and contains information on an individual's 
- marital status
- age 
- type of work, and more. 

The target column, or what we want to predict, is whether individuals make less than or equal to 50k a year, or more than 50k a year. The dataset can be accessed from the [University of California, Irvine's website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).
