    "# Introduction to Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a powerful and popular machine learning technique. The basic concept is very similar to trees that we commonly use to aid decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning techniques enables us to automatically construct a decision tree that tells us what outcomes we should predict in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome. \n",
    "- One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following work is a walk through of the building blocks of making a decision tree automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be looking at individual income in the United States. \n",
    "The data is from the 1994 census, and contains information on an individual's \n",
    "- marital status\n",
    "- age \n",
    "- type of work, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The target column, or what we want to predict, is whether individuals make less than or equal to 50k a year, or more than 50k a year. The dataset can be accessed from the [University of California, Irvine's website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)."
