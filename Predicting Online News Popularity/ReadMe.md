# Online News Popularity

The dataset describes the online news on the website https://mashable.com/ and popularity of an article based on the number of times the article was shared. Every record on the dataset represents an online news article and has about 60 features associated with each article. Higher number of shares implies higher popularity of the article. We are trying to predict the number of shares an article can get based on a set of variables. In other words, can we build a model which can predict the number of times an article will be shared by online readers. 

The dataset can be accessed from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity#).

The results of the original analysis were presented in the following paper:
